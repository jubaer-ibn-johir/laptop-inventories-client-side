          <p >The Apple MacBook Air (M1, 2020) isn't just the best laptop Apple has ever made, it's the best laptop money can buy right now. This is the first time a MacBook has topped our list, but the MacBook Air (M1, 2020) is worthy of this spot.</p>

          <h3>Dell XPS 13</h3>
          <p>At this point, we doubt that the Dell XPS line can do anything wrong. Its yearly updates have consistently made it into our best laptops list, and theyâ€™re only getting better. The Dell XPS 13 (2020) is not only a gorgeous piece of kit.</p>

          <h3>Acer Swift 3</h3>
          <p >
          Beyond the Acer Swift 3's modest exterior, you'll find an excellent laptop that boasts plenty of power for work and study. The Swift 3 (not to be confused with the Switch 3 another laptop from Acer) is an inexpensive laptop.
